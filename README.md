a# **Algorithmic Patterns**

## **1. Two Pointers**
- Technique to solve problems by having two pointers starting at different positions and moving towards a condition.
- Useful for problems like finding a pair in a sorted array, or reversing a string in place.

## **2. Island**
- Used for solving matrix traversal problems like counting the number of islands in a grid.
- Often solved using DFS or BFS.

## **3. Fast and Slow Pointer**
- Also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" approach.
- Commonly used to detect cycles in a linked list or to find the middle of the list.

## **4. Sliding Window**
- Useful for problems involving subarrays of a fixed size or maximum/minimum sum problems.
- Efficiently solve problems by sliding a window over the data.

## **5. Merge Intervals**
- Merging overlapping intervals, typically used in scheduling and range-related problems.
- Often solved using sorting.

## **6. Cyclic Sort**
- Sorting an array of numbers when the numbers are in a specific range.
- Used for problems that involve finding missing or duplicate numbers.

## **7. In-place Reversal of a Linked List**
- Reversing a linked list using constant space.
- Commonly asked in interview questions involving linked lists.

## **8. Tree Breadth-First Search**
- Traversing a tree level by level.
- Useful for problems involving shortest path in an unweighted graph.

## **9. Tree Depth First Search**
- Traversing a tree by going deep along one branch before moving to another.
- Useful for problems like finding paths, tree diameter, etc.

## **10. Two Heaps**
- Technique for efficiently keeping track of the median of a stream of numbers.
- Uses a max heap and a min heap.

## **11. Subsets**
- Finding all possible subsets of a given set.
- Can be solved using backtracking or iterative approaches.

## **12. Modified Binary Search**
- Binary search with variations to solve non-trivial searching problems.
- Examples include finding rotation points or closest elements in a sorted array.

## **13. Top 'K' elements**
- Finding the top K elements in a collection.
- Can be solved efficiently using heaps or quickselect.

## **14. Bitwise XOR**
- Bit manipulation technique.
- Useful for problems like finding missing numbers in an array.

## **15. Backtracking**
- Trying all possible solutions and backtracking once an invalid solution is reached.
- Commonly used in solving problems like Sudoku, N-Queens, etc.

## **16. 0/1 Knapsack**
- A dynamic programming problem involving maximizing value without exceeding weight.
- Uses a table to store intermediate results.

## **17. Topological Sort**
- Sorting directed graphs with dependencies.
- Used in problems involving course scheduling or task ordering.

## **18. K-way Merge**
- Merging K sorted lists into a single sorted list.
- Uses a min-heap for efficient merging.

## **19. Monotonic Stack**
- Stack used to maintain elements in a sorted order.
- Useful for solving problems involving the next greater or smaller element.

## **20. Multi Thread**
- Concurrently executing multiple threads for parallel computation.
- Helps in optimizing performance in multi-core systems.
